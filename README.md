## Project Overview

SAR images are grayscale and often challenging to interpret. This project uses a deep learning model to colorize SAR images, making them visually rich and easier to analyze. The web interface built with **React** and **Vite** allows users to:

- Upload SAR images.
- Process and colorize the images using a deep learning model.
- View and download the colorized images.

---

## Features

- **Deep Learning-Based Colorization**: Applies a trained neural network to colorize SAR images.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with React and Vite for a fast and responsive experience.
- **Real-Time Processing**: See colorization results in real-time.
- **Image Upload & Download**: Easily upload SAR images and download the processed results.
- **Accessibility Support**: Modal accessibility and keyboard navigation support.
